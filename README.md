The **Currency Converter Project** is a web-based application designed for users to seamlessly convert currencies between various countries. It features a user-friendly **home page** with a brief about the services, exchange rate trends, and navigation buttons like **Home** and **Login**. A dedicated **Convert a Currency** button directs users to a registration page. 

Key functionalities include:

1. **Registration**: Users can register by providing their email, username, and password.
2. **Login System**: Only registered users can log in; incorrect credentials trigger an error message.
3. **Currency Conversion**: After logging in, users can access a neatly aligned converter that displays results with proper currency symbols in a table format.
4. **Multi-Country Support**: The system supports conversions for several currencies, with options to expand.
5. **Enhanced Design**: Includes customizable background colors and clean layout, ensuring a professional appearance.

This project combines **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to deliver functionality without relying on APIs or external databases, focusing on user engagement and a seamless experience.
